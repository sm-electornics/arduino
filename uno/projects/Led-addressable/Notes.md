# Arduino LED Addressable WS28 LED Strip

### Features
- The WS2812B addressable LED strip comes in several varieties that differ in size, sealant or LED density
- This LED strip is made by WS2812B LEDs wired in series. These LEDs have a IC built right into the LED. This allows a communication via a one-wire interface. This means that we can control lots of LEDs using just one digital pin of your Arduino.
- This kind of strips are very flexible and can be cut to any length you want. Each strip is divided into segments, and each segment contains one RGB LED.  
- The LED strip should be powered using a 5V power source. At 5V, each LED draws about 50mA, when set to its full brightness.  This means that for every 30 LEDs, the strip may draw as much as 1.5 A. Make sure you select a power source that matches the stripâ€™s needs.
